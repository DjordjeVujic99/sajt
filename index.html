<h1>Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin</h1>
<p> <img src="pupin.jpg" alt="mihajlo pupin"><strong>Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D. (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 9 October 1858 – 12 March 1935)</strong>, also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist.<br> 

Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of long-distance telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire (known as "pupinization").<br> 

Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which later became NASA.
